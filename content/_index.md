Welcome to the official site for the Cowrie SSH and Telnet Honeypot Project!

# What is Cowrie

Cowrie is a medium interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to
log brute force attacks and the shell interaction performed by the
attacker. Cowrie also functions as an SSH and telnet proxy to observe
attacker behavior to another system.
